Proof of Concept for file viewer using python flask (Fake comic viewer)
1. Just click setup.cmd to install flask

2. Run "start application.cmd" to start the flask server (only for windows)
3. (there shouldnt be the need to but) if you need to restart the flask server, just press control-c twice, the script will automatically restart the server

4. Files to display are stored in "Files" directory

5. "application.py" is the main python script
6. "static" directory stores static scripts (such as stylesheets and javascripts to import)
7. "templaes" directory stores the html templates to render
